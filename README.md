## Overview

This project is a modular full-stack web platform built using modern React architecture and cloud-based infrastructure.

It supports:

- Public-facing website layers  
- Role-restricted dashboard environments  
- Secure content management  
- Real-time data synchronization  
- File handling workflows  
- Protected application routing  

The system demonstrates scalable application structure, secure data patterns, and production-oriented architecture.
